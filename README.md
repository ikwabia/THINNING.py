**THINNING IN RELATION TO STAND COMPOSITION, AGE AND SPECIES EFFECTS  ON DBH OF TREES** 

The mixture  of oak  and pines is of considerable  importance  and would become more important under climate  change, therefore  the performance  and increase  in DBH under different  stand composition  and age when thinned  are therefore being  assessed. 

Research regarding  forest growth  and yield  has being  focused on pure stands and mixed  stands, comparing  the two with different  application  of treatment  to achieve  the highest  growth and yield. 

Oaks started to spread across Europe immediately  after the end of the last glaciation  and were the dominating  forest species around 5,000 BC. Oak provide high  value  timber  for industry,  biomass for bio-energy  production,  key habitats  for biodiversity  and valued environments  for recreation and other cultural  services.  

The Scots pine also known as the common  pine or red fir is one of the most important  tree species in Europe both economically  and ecologically.  It is the most well-known  and in central Europe, the most common  species of the genus *Pinus,* to which  more than 90 species in the northern  hemisphere  belongs. 

Its range covers all of Eurasia  and stretches from the polar circle  in the north to the south of Turkey and from the West of Germany  to Asia in the East. There are also isolated  occurrences in Scotland and the Pyrenees. 

Scots pines prefer a continental  climate;  therefore  their  natural  limit  of spread to the west runs across Germany.  The focal points  of their spread are the sandy regions  of Brandenburg  and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,  the north western Geest-areas and the upper Rhine  rift  between Karlsruhe  and Mainz/Frankfurt  as well  as the pre-Alps in Bayern. 

` `Approximately  73 % of German forests nowadays consist of mixed  stands. Spruce accounts for the largest share among  the tree species (28 %), followed  by pine (23 %), beech trees (15 %) and oak trees (10 %). The tree species proportions  vary and depend on the specific  natural  features and site conditions  as well  as on different  historic  developments. 

The task of German  silviculture  consists in shaping  forests in such a way that timber  is being efficiently  produced, the biological  productive  base of forests is being maintained  and improved and the services rendered by forests remain  usable by humans  in a sustainable  manner.  The multitude  of objectives  of silvicultural  management  depending  on the respective  site has resulted in a multitude  of silvicultural  operations that is in differentiated  treatment  and regeneration methods. Thinning  is an important  means to achieve  silvicultural  objective and has received considerable  attention  in forest research. Thinning  causes reduction  of density  and associated reduction  in resource use and competition,  which  increase  the growth  of the remaining  trees and reduces their mortality  rate. Also, photosynthetic  rate is highly  enhanced in leaves of the lower and middle  strata of the canopy through  thinning  (MEDHURST;  BEADLE,  2005). 

The objective  of this study is to find  out if thinning  done on a plot of trees has effect  on the diameter  at breast height  (DBH) taking  into consideration: 

1. Stand composition,  whether pure or mixed  stand 
1. Stand age 
1. The species of the tree on the thinned  plot in any of the stand composition  stated above. 

The study area is located in  Neuendorf, a town in the state of Brandenburg  in Germany  with latitude  52° 53' 30" N and longitude  14° 3' 26" E. The study was conducted on installed  Pine, Oak and Pine - Oak triplet  which  have been thinned  with  data on Diameter  at Breast Height (DBH) recorded before thinning.  Diameters  at 1.3m height  were measured. All the field  work was carried out using  the traditional  method of measuring  and calculating  the DBH of trees. 20 living  trees were selected randomly  from the pure pine stand, 20 living  trees from the oak pure stand, and 40 randomly  from pine-oak stand comprising  24 oak and 16 pine trees. The site condition  for the research plot is uniform.  Measurements  are therefore  taken after the thinning  to assess how responsive  of tree species and stand composition  to thinning  with respect to DBH. The stand age of the pure pine stand, pure oak stand and the pine-oak mixed  stand are 87 years, 80 years and 80 years respectively.  This research aimed to compare the parameters of the triplet in order to reveal the differences  that exist  between stand composition,  age and species with respect to thinning  and based on the findings  to define  the management  form in the future. 

A written  piece of code is used to determine  how thinning  affects DBH, as stated by objectives. REFERERENCES
